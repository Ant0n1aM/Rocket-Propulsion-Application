# Rocket-Propulsion-Application
Solve the following with a MATLAB script.
The equation of motion of a rocket-propelled sled is, from Newton's law
m * (dv/dt) = f-cv 
Where m is the sled mass,f is the rocket thrust, and c is an air resistance coefficient.Suppose that m = 1000kg and c = 500N*s/m. Suppose that v(0) = 0
• Plot the velocity of the rocket for the first 10 seconds for four values of f: o 20,000, 40,000, 60,000, and 80,000 N.
o Include a title, axis labels, a grid, and a legend
The velocity will be in m/s.
